# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is for Java Developers looking to start building applications with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) with [Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/).

The [workshop](https://java-repository.github.io/microservices-workshop/workshop) features several labs that walk you through the steps to get going with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud.

### About Micronaut

Micronaut is an innovative new server-side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications that use less memory and are smaller and faster because of ahead of time (AOT) compilation technology.

Micronaut also includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation time, making it a great fit for working with Autonomous Database.

### Objectives
This lab walks you through the steps to use Micronaut, Micronaut Data and Oracle Cloud to connected to an Oracle Database.

- Lab 1: Getting to know Micronaut 
- Lab 2: Writing Web Controllers
